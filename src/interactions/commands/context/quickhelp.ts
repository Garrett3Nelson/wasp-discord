Looks like the problem you've posted about is commonly solved by:
- Making sure you are fully up-to-date on SRL-T, WaspLib, and the script itself.
 - See: https://discord.com/channels/795071177475227709/1249458850587869236
- Making sure you are on Fixed - Classic Layout.
 - I've never had an issue on Fixed - Classic display mode and even use it when the author says resizable classic (ðŸ¤¢) works.
 - See: https://discord.com/channels/795071177475227709/1266728566024962100/1266728855398252604
- Making sure your client settings are correct (Brightness/XP Bar/etc.):
 - Use the Settings Searcher script to make sure all of your settings are right.
 - See: https://discord.com/channels/795071177475227709/1150590225555402802/1251695172450779137
- Making sure you are using the Wasp RuneLite profile.
 - RuneLite support is not carte blanche to use whatever plugins you want. Use only what is installed for you in the profile.
